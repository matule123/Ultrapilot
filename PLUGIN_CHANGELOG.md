Release history for individual plugins. See [PLUGIN_VERSIONS.md](PLUGIN_VERSIONS.md) for versioning rules.

## Map

### 1.0.1 — 2026-10-02

**Fixed**

- Recheck SDK observation freshness after localization.
- If the observation becomes stale during preparation, allow at most one fresh SDK read and localization retry.
- Reject control authority if no new valid observation is available.

**Preserved**

- Route identity checks and the 500 ms freshness limit.
- Existing steering controller behavior.

**Known limitation**

- This release does not establish or eliminate the internal cause of the long reference-preparation pause.
- Offline verification is not a live-game result.

Commit: `3ef65c7`.

### 1.0.0 — Versioning baseline

- Introduced independent version tracking for existing map dataset, localization and navigation-packet functionality.

## Other plugins — 1.0.0 baseline

Version 1.0.0 marks the start of independent versioning of existing code.
These are baseline capabilities, not claims that the features were newly
implemented or fully completed in that release. Older unversioned changes
are not retrospectively assigned to releases.

## Adding a release

Under the relevant plugin heading, add `### VERSION — YYYY-MM-DD`, newest first.
Use **Added**, **Fixed**, **Changed** and **Known limitations** as applicable.
Describe actual changes and include the commit when available.

Updating the version display changes the application UI, not plugin behavior,
so it does not itself increase plugin versions. Independent plugin distribution
and dependency compatibility checks remain planned, not implemented.
